# Auto-Insurance-Industry
1. The Problem
Auto insurance industry is witnessing a paradigm shift. Since auto insurance is a homogenous good (difficult to differentiate product A from product B), companies are fighting a price war. On top of that, distribution channel is shifting more from traditional insurance brokers to online purchase. This means that ability for companies to interact through human touch point is limited and customer should be quoted a good price. A good price quote is one which makes customer purchase the policy and helps the company to increase the profits.
Also, the insurance premium is calculated based on more than 50+ parameters. This means that traditional business analytics-based algorithms are now limited in their ability to differentiate among customers based on subtle parameters.
2. Goal
Build a Machine Learning Model to predict whether an owner will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year.
3. Use Cases
The model shall mainly support the following use cases:
1) Conquering Market Share: It should be possible to conquer market share by lowering the prices of the premium for the customers, who are least likely to claim.
2) Risk Management: It should be possible to charge right premium from the customer, who is likely to claim insurance in the coming year
3) Smooth Processing: It should be possible to reduce the complexity of pricing models, as with majority of transactions happening online and with more customer attributes available (thanks to internet and social media), time is ripe to harness the power of data and build complex ML models
4) Increased Profits: As per industry estimate 1% reduction in claim can boost profit by 10%. So, through ML model we can identify and deny the insurance to driver who will make the claim. Thus, ensuring reduced claim out go and increased profit.
Part of the model development is to identify and prioritize above use cases.
